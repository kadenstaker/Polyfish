"""Strength-ladder store (ladder.json) and gauge verdicts — EXP 10/11.

Anchors are frozen model files (greedy = Elo 0 floor); the last anchor is
"active". `record --kind gauge` appends an arena reading and answers:
continue / freeze (>=80% vs active) / stop (plateau, see _plateau).
Win/loss counts are always from the current model's side. Every reading
carries a Wilson interval and both verdicts are drawn from it, not from the
point estimate a ~64-game reading resolves to only +/-12pp. A reading that
dumped per-game stats also carries `paired`: the same games read per seed
across arena's side swap, which is tighter but steers nothing (see
_paired_from_stats).

Scope: the gauge is a fixed Imperius-mirror instrument while self-play trains
on a 5-tribe pool. Pinning the pair is deliberate variance control — the tribe
block effect rivals a campaign's whole measured improvement — but it makes
every ladder Elo a statement about Imperius-vs-Imperius play, not about the
distribution training optimizes. `--kind tribe_audit` rows are the cross-check
on that gap; they carry the pair they were played on and never enter a verdict.
`--tribes` is the pair the *match* used, read off arena, never the pair
self-play trained on that iteration (#34).
