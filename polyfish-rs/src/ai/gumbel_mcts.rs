//! Gumbel MuZero search agent.
//!
//! This is a from-scratch implementation of the Gumbel MuZero search from
//! "Learning and Planning in the Space of Convex Utility Functions"
//! (Danihelka et al., 2022). It replaces the earlier broken Gumbel agent,
//! which used the wrong child-selection formula and physically truncated the
//! root's child list after each halving round (collapsing the exported
//! policy target to ~1-2 actions).
//!
//! Key properties of this implementation:
//!   - The root holds **all** legal moves as children (never truncated). A
//!     separate `in_cut` index vector selects the top-`k` by `logit + gumbel`
//!     that actually get searched via Sequential Halving.
//!   - Root selection is round-robin Sequential Halving with equal per-round
//!     visit allocation, batched into one NN call per wave.
//!   - Interior (non-root) selection uses the paper's
//!     `softmax(logit + sigma(completed-Q))` rule with the
//!     `probs - visits/(1+sum visits)` reduction, not the old
//!     `argmax(logit + Q)`.
//!   - The policy target π'(a) ∝ exp(logit(a) + sigma(completed-Q(a))) is
//!     evaluated once over the **full** legal set, so every legal move
//!     receives non-zero support — fixing the policy-collapse bug.
//!   - Value backpropagation (including the player-aware sign flip) is
//!     shared with the AlphaZero agent via `mcts_common`.
